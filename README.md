# [effective-auto-waffle] Test Autamation framework based on Playwright and Typescript

## 1 - About the author

Hi all and welcome to my first public repository! My name is Slava. I am a QA Engineer with expertise in functional and non-functional testing, ensuring software quality across web, mobile, and integrated systems. My experience includes:
- Functional Testing: New features, web services, integration testing, smoke/regression testing, mobile testing.
- Non-Functional Testing: Compatibility, UI/GUI, usability, internationalization/localization, and requirements validation.
- Bug Reporting & Verification: Identifying, documenting, and tracking issues for efficient resolution.
- Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding: Creating structured plans and delivering onboarding sessions to newcomers, ensuring smooth transitions and understanding.
- Test Documentation: Writing, updating, and reviewing test cases, plans, and reports for accuracy and clarity.

Now I'm learning test automation, focusing on JavaScript, Playwright, and TypeScript, to enhance testing efficiency and broaden my technical skill set.

## 2 - Apps under test
- https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/
This web application is a contact list application with a web UI component and a REST API component. Itâ€™s excellent as a dummy web application because it allows us to practice more than just UI testing. This app was created by [Kristin Jackvony](https://thinkingtester.com/about/).
- TBD

ðŸš§Under construction!ðŸš§

## 4 - Notes
- User credentials should be stored in .env file in the root directory.

<br>`CONTACT_LIST_USER_LOGIN = 'your_user_for_login_test'`
<br>`CONTACT_LIST_PASS = ''`

- Create folder `states` in `src/contactList/data`
- Create in `states` folder `contactListApiAuth.json` and `contactListUiAuth.json`
- Put in each file following: `{ "cookies": [ { } ], "origins": [] }`
