- Test Documentation: Writing, updating, and reviewing test cases, plans, and reports for accuracy and clarity.
I am also learning test automation, focusing on JavaScript, Playwright, and TypeScript, to enhance testing efficiency and broaden my technical skill set.

## 2 - Apps under test

This web application is a contact list application with a web UI component and a REST API component. Itâ€™s excellent as a dummy web application because it allows us to practice more than just UI testing. This app was created by [Kristin Jackvony](https://thinkingtester.com/about/).
